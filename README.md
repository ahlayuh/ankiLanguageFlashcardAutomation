# LANGUAGE FLASHCARD MAKER


## Project Description
This Flask-based web application allows users to enter words or phrases, select a source language and a target language, and get the translations in a downloadable CSV file. The app uses Google Translate's `googletrans` package to provide translations.

## Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To keep your project dependencies isolated, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. You can create one by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```python -m venv .venv```


### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

For Windows:
```.venv\Scripts\activate```

For macOS/Linux:
```source .venv/bin/activate```


### 3. Install the Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, including Flask and `googletrans`. 

*Please note that this project uses Python 3.10 as it is the latest version compatible with the `googletrans` package.*



## Usage

### 1. Run the Application

Start the Flask server by running:

```python app.py```


This will launch the app at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

### 2. Using the Web Interface

- On the main page (`/`), you will be presented with a form to enter words/phrases for translation.
- Select a source language and target language from the dropdown menus.
- Enter the words/phrases (one per line) in the provided text box.
- Click the "Translate" button to begin translation.
- Once the translation is complete, a CSV file (`translations.csv`) will be generated and available for download.

### 3. Downloading Translations

After submitting the form, the `translations.csv` file containing your translations will be downloaded automatically.  
The CSV file will have two columns:
- **Original**: The original word/phrase.
- **Translated**: The translated word/phrase (or "Error" if the translation failed).



## Project Files

### `app.py`

This is the main Python file where the Flask application is defined. It contains:
- A route for rendering the main page (`/`).
- A route for handling translation requests (`/translate`).
- A route for downloading the generated CSV file (`/download`).
- Functions for translating words using `googletrans` and saving them to a CSV file.

### `index.html`

This is the HTML template located in the `templates` directory. It renders the main form for inputting words and selecting languages.

### `translations.csv`

This file will be generated by the application after translation and can be downloaded by the user. It contains the translations of the inputted words.

### `.venv`

This folder contains the virtual environment for the project. You should not need to modify this directory, and it is typically added to `.gitignore` to avoid version control issues.

### `static/`

This folder contains static files (such as `styles.css` and `earth-logo.png`). You can add styles and scripts here if needed.

### `templates/`

This folder contains HTML templates used by Flask. The `index.html` template renders the form to enter words and select languages.

### `requirements.txt`

This file lists all the Python packages required to run the application. You can install the dependencies by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Requirements

- Python 3.10.0
- Flask 3.1.0
- googletrans 4.0.0rc1


## Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## How It Works

1. **Word Input**: The user enters a list of words or phrases into a text box on the form (one per line).
2. **Language Selection**: The user selects the source and target languages from the dropdown menus.
3. **Translation**: When the user submits the form, the app calls the `googletrans` library to translate the entered words from the source language to the target language.
4. **CSV Generation**: After translation, the translations are saved to a `translations.csv` file, which is then made available for download.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the translation process (e.g., an unsupported language or a connectivity issue), the word will be marked as "Error" in the CSV file. Error handling can be further improved.
